# KIT301-ICT-Project
My completed work from the capstone unit of the University of Tasmania Batchelor Degree of ICT - Software Development - VR software to be used with the HTC Vive for the Geology department at the University of Tasmania

I have decided not to include the project files because the software is owned by the University of Tasmania. 

The link below is a video I created for the project and discusses the software features and design philosphy.
